pathwayfrac_mu.txt and pathwayfrac_nu.txt have three columns, namely, the shear value, fractional contribution of the corresponding pathway, and standard error.

anisotropy.txt has three columns, namely, the shear value, the anisotropy parameter, and standard error.

Rx.txt, Ry.txt and Rz.txt have three columns, namely, the shear value, 2*diffusion constant in the direction x, y and z, and 2*standard error in diffusion constant.
