Data is in shearsweep.
shearsweep/{symms,asymms,curr} contain data for symmetric flux strategies, asymmetric flux strategies, and current strategies.
D0AA.txt contains the Dij matrix elements for i,j=1,2,...,N, j>i
shear.txt contains array of all shear values tested
omega.txt contains corresponding values of densities of the two states and flows between the two states. 
Each shear sweep was repeated three times with different noise realizations.
