Data is in paramsweep.

c2v_S_oh_AS_c2v contains data for first panel of figure.
S_AS_C_null contains data for second and third panels.

In each folder, .txt files contain the values of the parameters and the corresponding yields and fluxes.
D0running.txt contains matrix elements for bond energy. At every step, 15 consecutive elements have matrix indices i,j where i,j=1,2,..,6 and j>i. In total we evaluated observables for 41 steps of linear interpolation. Each such sweep was repeated three times with independent statistical realizations.
shear.txt contains the shear flow rate, which was kept fixed.
omega.txt contains the yields of the two states and the forward and backward fluxes, corresponding to each bond energy matrix and shear.

See sifig2.py to reproduce the plot.
