catalysis/{shear0,shear25} contain data for the number of colored particles as a function of time.
Each case has three statistical realizations with independent thermal noise.

paramsweep contains data on yield and hopping flux from multiple statistical realizations at shear=1 and shear=25.
In each subfolder, the .txt files contain the parameter values and the corresponding flow and flux row by row.
D0running.txt contains D values.
shear.txt contains shear rates.
Yekrunning.txt contains \epsilon and \kappa values for the Yukawa potential.
In omega.txt, first and third columns contain the yield and the hopping flux.

See fig4.py to reproduce the plot.
