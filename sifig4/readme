den_1 is for optimizing yield of microphase at shear=1.
den_25 is for optimizing yield of microphase at shear=25.
f500_1 is for optimizing yield of microphase at shear=1, with lag-time \tau fixed at 500 time steps.
f500_25 is for optimizing yield of microphase at shear=25, with lag-time \tau fixed at 500 time steps.

Each folder has .txt files with the parameter and observable values at each optimization step.
D0running.txt contains D values.
shear.txt contains shear rates.
Yekrunning.txt contains \epsilon and \kappa values for the Yukawa potential.
In omega.txt, the second column is the value of the observable, unscaled by the number of particles.

See sifig4.py to reproduce the plot.
