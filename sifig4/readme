Data is in shearsweep and alphmatch

shearsweep/{symms,asymms,curr} contain data for symmetric flux strategies, asymmetric flux strategies, and current strategies.
D0AA.txt contains the Dij matrix elements for i,j=1,2,...,N, j>i
shear.txt contains array of all shear values tested
omega.txt contains corresponding values of densities of the two states and flows between the two states. 
Each shear sweep was repeated three times with different noise realizations.

alphmatch has plots of the optimized alphabets as .png files and the optimized Dij values as .txt files. Each alphabet file contains Dij matrix elements for i,j=1,2,...,N, j>i

See sifig4.py to reproduce the plot.
