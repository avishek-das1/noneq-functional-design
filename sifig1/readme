Each of the six folders contain the corresponding optimization data.
For example, oh_c2v_q2 contain data for optimizing flux q from oh to c2v, starting from the alphabet C.
In each folder, .txt files contain running information during the optimization.
sheartot.txt contains the shear flow rate at every optimization step.
D0runningtot.txt contains the matrix elements for bond energy, given every optimization step. At every step, 15 consecutive elements have matrix indices i,j where i,j=1,2,..,6 and j>i.
omegatot.txt contains the observable in the second column, at every optimization step.

See sifig1.py to reproduce the plot.
